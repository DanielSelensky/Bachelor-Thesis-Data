0,0,0,How has the demand for long distance trains changed since the pre-Covid era?,"Compared to the demand in the pre-Covid era, the demand for long distance trains has increased slightly. With 45.5 billion passenger-kilometers 2023 the highest volume sold for long distance trains, higher than in 2019, which was the year with the most long dinstance train demand in the pre-Covid era with 44.2 billion passegner-kilometers. The development of the volume sold of long distance trains shows a growth after a drop in the Covid years, with the volume sold in 2023 being 9% higher than in the previous year. In total, the demand has recovered after the Covid years and even slightly increased compared to the pre-Covid years.","The demand for long-distance trains has increased since the pre-Covid era. This is evident from the volume sold (in billion passenger kilometers or bn pkm) in long-distance transport as shown in the first image:

- In 2019 (pre-Covid), the volume sold was 44.2 bn pkm.
- In 2023 (post-Covid), the volume sold increased to 45.5 bn pkm.

This indicates a growth in demand, as the volume sold in 2023 (post-Covid) is higher than the volume sold in 2019 (pre-Covid). Additionally, the first image highlights a 9.0% increase in volume development from 2022 to 2023, further supporting the growth in demand for long-distance transport.",0.5982142857142857,"The images indicate a significant improvement in long-distance rail performance. Specifically, the long-distance passenger kilometers (pkm) have increased by 9.0%, from 41.7 billion pkm in 2022 to 45.5 billion pkm in 2023. This suggests a substantial growth in demand for long-distance trains since the pre-Covid era, highlighting a recovery and possibly an increase in passenger usage post-pandemic.",0.5384615384615384,"Based on the given data, the demand for long-distance trains has seen significant changes from the pre-Covid era to the present post-Covid era.

### Pre-Covid Era:
- **2017**: 40.5 billion passenger-kilometers (bn pkm)
- **2018**: 42.8 bn pkm (a +5.6% increase from 2017)
- **2019**: 44.2 bn pkm (a +3.1% increase from 2018)

This data shows a steady year-on-year increase in demand for long-distance train travel from 2017 to 2019.

### Post-Covid Era:
- **2022**: 41.7 bn pkm
- **2023**: 45.5 bn pkm (a +9.0% increase from 2022)

Here, there is a notable recovery and growth in demand for long-distance train travel post-Covid, with the volume surpassing pre-Covid levels.

### Comparative Analysis:
- **2019** (Pre-Covid): 44.2 bn pkm
- **2022** (Post-Covid): 41.7 bn pkm (still slightly below 2019 levels)
- **2023** (Post-Covid): 45.5 bn pkm (exceeding 2019 levels)

From the data, it is clear that the demand for long-distance trains has not only recovered to pre-Covid levels by 2023 but has actually increased beyond those levels. The trend shows a robust recovery with a significant growth rate in 2023.",0.3469387755102041

1. Calculate the absolute difference in emissions:
   \( 31 \, \text{g CO₂e/pkm (bus)} - 1 \, \text{g CO₂e/pkm (train)} = 30 \, \text{g CO₂e/pkm} \)

1. **User Input**: The process begins when a user enters the search query or feedback on the website, which is hosted on AWS Amplify.

2. **API Gateway**: The website passes the input query or feedback to Amazon API Gateway, which receives the response from the API Gateway.

3. **Search, Question, and Answer Component**: The API Gateway passes the input query to the search, question, and answer component. This component has AWS Lambda integrated with Langchain, an open-source framework. The model library is served by Amazon Bedrock or Amazon SageMaker.

4. **Search Engine Invocation**: AWS Lambda invokes the search engine component, which can be either Amazon OpenSearch Service or Amazon Kendra. The Lambda function retrieves search results from the search engine.

5. **Combining Query and Search Results**: The Lambda function inputs the prompt, which combines the query and search results returned from the search engine. It utilizes the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process to optimize the output of the large language model (LLM) and returns the suggested answer from the LLM to the API Gateway.

2. **Sprint Plan Meeting**:
   - The Development Team, along with the Product Owner, participates in the **Sprint Plan Meeting**. During this meeting, items from the Product Backlog are selected and planned for the upcoming sprint. The selected items are then moved to the **Sprint Backlog**.

3. **Sprint (1-4 weeks)**:
   - A **Sprint** typically lasts between 1 to 4 weeks. This is the development phase where the Development Team works on the items in the Sprint Backlog. Daily progress is monitored through **24H Daily Scrum** meetings, which are short, time-boxed stand-up meetings.

4. **Sprint Review & Sprint Retrospective**:
   - At the end of the sprint, a **Sprint Review Meeting** is held to demonstrate the completed work to the stakeholders. This is followed by a **Sprint Retrospective** meeting where the team reflects on the sprint and discusses what went well, what didn’t, and how processes can be improved.

5. **Finished Work**:
   - The output of the sprint is the **Finished Work**, which is the potentially shippable product increment that meets the definition of ""done.""
